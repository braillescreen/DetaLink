# DetaLink
## what it does
It speaks the title of the page a link goes to, without actually opening it. Remember those bit.ly links? Just press nvda+alt+q on them, and you'll find out what they actually link to, therefore  you'll be able to decide if they are worth opening. The same with youTube clips.
Also, if the link is an mp4 or aac audio, it plays it without opening a player. To stop the audio, just focus a non-link element and press nnvda+alt+q again. It is not possible to restart the playback from where you stopped, this was designed only for small files.
## how to build
Just zip the contents of the addon folder and change the extension to .nvda-addon
